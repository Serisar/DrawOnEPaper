# HtmlToImageToEPaper

This project aims to collect various datapoints like weather forecast, bus timetable, shopping list or ToDo lists and display them on an epaper display.
For this the data will be collected with a python script that creates a html/css file that creates the layout in a format that fits the 800x480p two colour Waveshare epaper display.
To send the information to the display it has to be converted into an image.
